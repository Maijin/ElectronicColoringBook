<p>The name is obviously a wordplay with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29">Electronic Codebook</a>, the simplest but also the most insecure chaining mode of operations to be used with a block cipher.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The disadvantage of this method is that identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks; thus, it does not hide data patterns well. In some senses, it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality, and it is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols at all.
A striking example of the degree to which ECB can leave plaintext data patterns in the ciphertext can be seen when ECB mode is used to encrypt a bitmap image which uses large areas of uniform color. While the color of each individual pixel is encrypted, the overall image may still be discerned as the pattern of identically colored pixels in the original remains in the encrypted version.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is typically illustrated with our favorite mascot:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Tux_ecb.jpg" alt="ecb tux"></p>

<p>Yes we can see it despite it's encrypted, but it's neither that obvious nor visually satisfying, for several reasons we'll explain. We can do better! And that's the goal of this little project.</p>

<p>Those ECB exemplary images are made artificially: the author knows the original file format (width, height, pixel encoding) and typically overwrites the encrypted header with the original one.</p>

<p>But when a file is encrypted and you don't know anything about it, it's not that simple.
<br>One example is the 300 points challenge of the <em>2014 Nuit du Hack CTF Quals</em> called <em>The Another One</em>. All you get is an encrypted BMP (as you can guess from the file extension). More details on the resolution of that challenge are available <a href="http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/NDH_Writeups#Another_One">here</a>.</p>

<p>It appears quickly that there are recurring encrypted blocks but practical problems are to recover the unknown parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>width and height of the image</li>
<li>pixel encoding. Here it's a BMP but BMP can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Pixel_format">encode each pixel</a> in 1 bit, 2 bits, 4 bits, 8 bits, 16 bits, 24 bits or 32 bits so that doesn't really help.</li>
<li>layout. Here it's a BMP so starting from bottom left to top right, line by line.</li>
</ul><p>Pixel encoding, width and height link back to the total encrypted file size:</p>

<p><em>header + width * height * bytes_per_pixel + padding = filesize</em></p>

<p>Here is another example we'll walk through. For the record the binary blob was created from some ppm (as we need a non-compressed bitmap to start with) as:</p>

<p><code>openssl enc -e -aes-128-ecb -in test.ppm -out test.bin -k toto</code></p>

<p>test.bin is available <a href="./images/test.bin">here</a></p>

<p>At first we'll use a square ratio and color each byte.</p>

<p><img src="./images/test.bin.1.png" alt="test.bin.1"></p>

<p>Nothing really recognizable, isn't it?</p>

<p>For the record, this image was produced with our tool, asking for a raw rendering and square ratio:</p>

<p><code>ecb-colorize.py test.bin --raw --ratio=1:1</code></p>

<p>But we'll see our tool can do much better!</p>

<h3>
<a name="electroniccoloringbookpy" class="anchor" href="#electroniccoloringbookpy"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ElectronicColoringBook.py</h3>

<p>ElectronicColoringBook.py is a Python (doh!) script implementing a number of options we'll discover.</p>

<p>Its goal is to paint over recurring ECB blocks to reveal more easily, and more nicely, the structure of an ECB-encrypted file. It does so by first computing an histogram of recurring blocks, then map it to a color map. It also tries to guess the right ratio with some fast stupid auto-correlation.</p>

<p>By default, it assumes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a blocksize of 16 bytes, which is the blocksize of AES</li>
<li>an unknown ratio, to be guessed</li>
<li>one byte per pixel</li>
<li>16 colors will be used: the most widespread block in white, the next 14 randomly, and all remaining blocks will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6d8eKvegLI">painted in black</a>
</li>
</ul><p>Let's see:</p>

<p><code>ecb-colorize.py test.bin</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/test.bin.2.png" alt="test.bin.2"></p>

<p>Already better!</p>

<p>Image is too wide but, given the pixel width, the ratio was correctly recovered and the lines properly wrapped. So we need to adjust the pixel width to compress horizontally the image:</p>

<p><code>ecb-colorize.py test.bin --pixelwidth=3</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/test.bin.3.png" alt="test.bin.3"></p>

<p>Remember intermediate colors are picked-up randomly so at each attempt it changes.</p>

<p>Now that the ratio and pixel width are correct we can observe vertical stripes. That happens when you can't have an exact number of pixels in each block and that's exactly the case here: we guessed each pixel requires 3 bytes and the blocksize is 16 so if pixels of the same color are side by side we get e.g. assuming pixels of color <code>#AABBCC</code> three types of block content, each of them encrypted to some gibberish:</p>

etc

<p>The histogram given by our tool shows it clearly too:</p>

<p>See the number of occurrences? (2nd column) We can group them by three: 7528&amp;7497&amp;7459, 1100&amp;1083&amp;1014, etc.</p>

<p>So let's do it:</p>

<p><code>ecb-colorize.py test.bin -p 3 --group=3</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/test.bin.4.png" alt="test.bin.4"></p>

<p>Still one more thing: Pluto's tail is wrapped, that's because before the real data there is the image header (here a PPM header) and in this case a salt because of the way we used openssl.
So we can apply a small offset to skip them. As we're working with blocks it can't be perfect. Here best is to skip two blocks, so 32 bytes:</p>

<p><code>ecb-colorize.py test.bin -p 3 -g 3 --offset=2</code></p>

<p><img src="./images/test.bin.5.png" alt="test.bin.5"></p>
