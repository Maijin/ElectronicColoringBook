In some senses, it doesn't provide serious message confidentiality, and it is not recommended for use in cryptographic protocols at all.\r\n> A striking example of the degree to which ECB can leave plaintext data patterns in the ciphertext can be seen when ECB mode is used to encrypt a bitmap image which uses large areas of uniform colour. While the colour of each individual pixel is encrypted, the overall image may still be discerned as the pattern of identically coloured pixels in the original remains in the encrypted version.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
